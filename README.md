## Introduction
This project focuses on the development and testing of various AI models and algorithms used in autonomous systems. It covers both the theoretical background and practical implementation of these models.

## Theoretical Framework
### Artificial Intelligence
Explores the paradigms of symbolic, connectionist, and behavioral AI, and how intelligent agents are characterized by autonomy, reactivity, proactivity, and sociability.

### Dynamic Models
Describes the structure, dynamics, and behavior of computational systems and how they evolve over time.

### Software Engineering
Focuses on the specification, development, and maintenance of software systems to ensure efficiency, reliability, and quality.

### Reactive Agents
Details the architecture of agents that respond to stimuli with pre-defined rules and behaviors.

### Automatic Reasoning
Explains how computational systems solve problems automatically by exploring and evaluating options.

### State Space Search
Covers methods for solving planning problems by searching through state spaces.

### Deliberative Agents
Discusses agents that use memory and anticipation of future states to make decisions.
